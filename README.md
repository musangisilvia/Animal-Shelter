### Project Description
    This project was created for an animal shelter. It entails some background information on the Animal shelter, The animals kept in the shelter and those that are up for adoption. Mollie's Animals shelter was started five years ago by a lady called Mollie. She had a litter of Kitten to start with. Over the five years she has been able to get more animals, some through donation and others from the streets. Every year they put up animals for adoption after the animals have undergone basic training. Her team has to ascertain the animals characteristics before putting them for adoption. This is to say that an animal has to stay in the shelter for roughly a whole year before being adopted.
