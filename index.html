        <h2>About Mollie's Animal Shelter</h2>
        <p>This is one of the biggest animal shelters in the country Kenya. Here we keep all types of animals from <span>Dogs</span> to <span>Puppies</span> and <span>Cats</span>. It was started about 5 years ago with omly a litter of kittens to tend. Over the five years, it has grown to be one of the best places that animals can call home (in their language of course!).
        Here is a list of animals we keep.
          <ul>
            <li>Dogs</li>
            <li>Cats</li>
            <li>Reptiles</li>
            <li>Parrots</li>
            <li>Small animals like mice</li>
          </ul>
        Most of the animals we keep are stray dogs and cats</p>

        <h2>Animals up for Adoption</h2>
        <p> Every year, we put some animals up for adoption. this is to reduce the population of the animals in the shelter but most importantly it is to enable families to adopt the animals as their pets!</p>
